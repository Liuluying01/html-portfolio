<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I was born in Shanghai, China. I spent my first 26 years of life in my hometown Shanghai until 2015 when it was the third year after I graduated from Shanghai Finance University, then I deciced to go to New Zealand for my further study, and susccessfully abtain Mater of Supply Chan Management the following year. </p>
<p>Iâ€˜ve been in supply chain area for almost 10 years, including two-and-harf-year work in China as purchasing officer in automotive industry and 7-year work in New Zealand as  logistics coordinator, procurement manager and supply chain manager in food industry. </p>
<p>I am a quick learner, and I have a strong self-learning ability. Besides, I can manage time effectively and always get tasks done prior to deadline. I am also a reliable person and have a high sense of responsibility. If some urgent issues happen, I will deal with it immediately, instead of leaving it to the last minute.</p>
<p>In 2023, I started to learn web development at my spare time. This is a very brand new area for me. Eventually I found it very interesting and enjoy learning this new skill. I leant it  on Udemy which is a very popular on line learning platform. Although I encoutered many challenges through the way of study, thanks for the amazing teacher, she always inspired us to insist. And every time I come over the difficulties, I feel a huge of sense of achievemnt. I love that feeling and started to consider why not try to become a web developer/ programmer and see if there's any different possibility in my life.</p>
<p>Apart from learning new skill, I enjoy reading, Karaoke, meeting friends in my leisure time. I also loving travelling. I travel a lot during holiday. I'd even gone to the USA working holiday during university. That's an unforgettable exeperience for me! </p>
<p>This is me! If you are interested, feel free to contact me.</p>
